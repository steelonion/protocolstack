# Virtual Protocol Stack

## Introduction

This project aims to implement a common protocol stack using software, allowing for the simulation of computer nodes within software.

## Implementation

- [x] ARP
- [x] ICMP/Ping
- [ ] ICMP
- [x] IP
- [x] UDP
- [x] TCP/Client
- [ ] TCP/Server

## Issues

Currently, it seems that Windows intercepts packets with non-network card MAC addresses during testing, causing the test program to be unable to respond to external messages.

## Usage

Please refer to the unit test project and CLI project for details.
